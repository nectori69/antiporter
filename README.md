(EXTREMELY WIP) Half-Life 1 mod.
<br>
one day i'll write a decent description for this
<br>
<br>
<br>
### TODO:
<sub>(in no particular order of importance)</sub>
<br>
-fix materials.txt being unruly
<br>
-implement a new hud rendering system (precise rendering (that doesn't blur things), scaling, the works)
<br>
-implement more modular muzzle flash particles, maybe adapt to other instances of particles too?
<br>
-weapon recoil (aim-adjusting, not cosmetic (but having recoil movement on weapons would make them nicer to use))
<br>
-smoother movement for some viewmodel things (jumping should make the gun bounce a little, etc etc)
<br>
-GLSL maybe?
<br>
-mess w/ hud organization somehow
<br>
-credits menu!
