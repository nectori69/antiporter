# antiporter
(EXTREMELY WIP) Half-Life 1 mod.

# TODO:
(in no particular order of importance)
-fix materials.txt being unruly
-implement a new hud rendering system (precise rendering (that doesn't blur things), scaling, the works)
-implement more modular muzzle flash particles, maybe adapt to other instances of particles too?
-weapon recoil (aim-adjusting, not cosmetic (but having recoil movement on weapons would make them nicer to use))
-smoother movement for some viewmodel things (jumping should make the gun bounce a little, etc etc)
-GLSL maybe?
-mess w/ hud organization somehow
-credits menu!
